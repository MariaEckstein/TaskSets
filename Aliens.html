  /*
  from the grant proposal:
  "We will investigate whether
  agents operate reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, with executive functions
  providing abstract contexts and rules as options whose values should be learned."
  "We%will%use%behavioral%
experiments,% computational% modeling,% EEG,% and% fMRI% to% investigate% whether% abstract% contexts% and% abstract%
rules% that% are% maintained% by% EF% provide% a% hierarchical% state% and% action% space% for% RL% value=based% learning."
  - it's about finding out whether and how RL (BG, striatum) interacts with EF (FC):
    RL is about slow incremental value learning;
    EF is about WM, goals, creating and representing contexts, abstract rules

    TDs
    - CHECK Tell people explicitly that colors and shapes do not determine aliens' preferences
    - CHECK Make button pictures black-and-white?
    - Train until criterion rather than fixed number of trials
    - Things to check when looking at data:
      - Do people learn or do they get everything right on the first try (in the second season)?
        -> do they learn or do they do inference? -> reduce mutual information? Add more aliens?
      - Do they remember TS?
        -> do they get it faster in subsequent repetitions? do they answer phase 2 right?
      - Do they learn values, i.e., do they pay attention to the numbers?
        -> can they tell me which alien-season-combos are better?
      - Interference between seasons?
        -> Do values spill over into new seasons?
      - Make sure the "best" seasons and aliens are actually best!
        -> Do participants make the most points in the right seasons / aliens? Equal for actions?
      - Enough trials?
        -> Do learning curves plateau at the end? In phase 3?
      - Phase 1: Do we have nice learning curves?
      - Phase 2: Do participants' responses agree with actual values?
      - Phase 4: Do participants select the most-valuable action? Or the not-yet used action?
        Or the most popular action? Or do they select each action once to make sure they got it right at least once?
        Does this make sense at all if one action can be applied to more than one alien, with different values?
      - Phase 5: Do participants select the most valuable TS in the new context?
        Or do they select the single best action for each alien?
        (This would mean that participants prefer marginalizing out seasons to marginalizing out aliens;
        that they prefer to keep the info about aliens, rather than about seasons
        ["which action was best for this alien (ignoring seasons)?" rather than
         "which season was best and which action went with which seasons there?"])
        Or do they do something random?
        In this case, it could be that (a) participants learn each season-alien-action association separately)
    - monetary bonus: we will pick one alien randomly and your payment will be based on that
    - make distributions wider -> right now, people just remember closest number anyway
    - add new TS to google slides!
    - make sure distributions don't shift over time
    - in phase 2, put everything side-by-side or everything on top of each other
    - add pics in instructions
    - respond "as fast and accurately as possible"
